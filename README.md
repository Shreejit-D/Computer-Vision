Attached are mini-projects done in the coursework - Robot Sensing and Navigation

Dead - Reckoning
In this project, a GPS and IMU were used to perform dead-reckoning (A pose estimation problem where we estimate the position (heading and co-ordinates) based on previous position and vehile kinematics.
I used complementary filters on IMU magnetometer yaw estimate and Gyroscope yaw estimate to calculate sensor fused yaw angle and use accelerometer readings to estimate distance covered. 
GPS co-ordinates and IMU yaw angles were used as ground-truths for compairing results.

Land mine localization Robot
It is a fun project were we were asked to design a robot which can detect and localize landmines, I have attached the concept powerpoints in this directory and the design will be attached in the CAD folder.

Image Stitching
Yet, another fun project where in we clicked consecutive images of graffitis, buildings and difficult images like cinder block. I used Harris corner detection for feature mapping. Following are the few images stitched using the algorithm -
