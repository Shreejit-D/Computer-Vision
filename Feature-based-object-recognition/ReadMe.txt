Real time object recognition using hu moments *
***********************************************

1. Google drive link for real time object detection video - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jS_IP5HvIEO_itJx1hZyXOvzj9AWQEgv/view?usp=sharing

2. Windows OS and code compiled in Visual Studio 2022.

3. For running executable, just use the .exe and follow the instructions to perform object recognition or feature storage in the .csv.
**Instructions - 
'i' to perform image recognition or storage OR 'v' to perform video recognition or storage
'r' for object recognition OR 's' for storing the object features in the .csv
'e' to perform euclidian distance feature matching OR 'k' to perform Knn classifier

***Note- Image/Video recognition will not work if there is no database for objects (data_base.csv) (std_dev.csv).
Reference .csv's are attached in case direct implementation of .exe is required.
