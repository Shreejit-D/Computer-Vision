**** The cross should be very clear as shown in the report, 
with proper lighting so that only 2 lines are visible for cross detection.
The cross should be held near to webcam as soon as we run the code, or else too many contours
will cause the program to collapse.
**** Add pikachu.png to the folder where the .exe is located or change the path in the main program.

Not using any time travel days.
